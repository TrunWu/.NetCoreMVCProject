# .NetCoreMVCProject 

My project is based on this project https://github.com/go2ismail/Asp.Net-Core-Inventory-Order-Management-System
But there were difference as I adopted PostgreSQL instead of MSSQL, and I hosted the app to Heroku with help of docker as Heroku did not support .Net.

Tech-stacks: Asp.net Core MVC 2.2 + postgresql + entity framework + docker + Heroku(cloud service)+ HTML/CSS/Javascript + Jquery

### how to run the app: for local deployment, use command: dotnet coderush.dll
